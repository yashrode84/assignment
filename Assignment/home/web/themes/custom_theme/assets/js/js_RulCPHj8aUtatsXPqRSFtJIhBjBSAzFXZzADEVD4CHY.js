/**
 * Prevents consecutive form submissions of identical form values.
 *
 * Repetitive form submissions that would submit the identical form values are
 * prevented, unless the form values are different from the previously
 * submitted values.
 *
 * This is a simplified re-implementation of a user-agent behavior that should
 * be natively supported by major web browsers, but at this time, only Firefox
 * has a built-in protection.
 *
 * A form value-based approach ensures that the constraint is triggered for
 * consecutive, identical form submissions only. Compared to that, a form
 * button-based approach would (1) rely on [visible] buttons to exist where
 * technically not required and (2) require more complex state management if
 * there are multiple buttons in a form.
 *
 * This implementation is based on form-level submit events only and relies on
 * jQuery's serialize() method to determine submitted form values. As such, the
 * following limitations exist:
 *
 * - Event handlers on form buttons that preventDefault() do not receive a
 *   double-submit protection. That is deemed to be fine, since such button
 *   events typically trigger reversible client-side or server-side operations
 *   that are local to the context of a form only.
 * - Changed values in advanced form controls, such as file inputs, are not part
 *   of the form values being compared between consecutive form submits (due to
 *   limitations of jQuery.serialize()). That is deemed to be acceptable,
 *   because if the user forgot to attach a file, then the size of HTTP payload
 *   will most likely be small enough to be fully passed to the server endpoint
 *   within (milli)seconds. If a user mistakenly attached a wrong file and is
 *   technically versed enough to cancel the form submission (and HTTP payload)
 *   in order to attach a different file, then that edge-case is not supported
 *   here.
 *
 * Lastly, all forms submitted via HTTP GET are idempotent by definition of HTTP
 * standards, so excluded in this implementation.
